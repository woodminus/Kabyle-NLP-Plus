# Kabyle-NLP-Plus
Improved natural language processing designed for the Kabyle language, incorporating new learning models and tokenization algorithms.

Main Algorithms: 
- The first will only generate the learning model, allowing it to be re-run to generate several models from several manually tagged corpora and save them on the disk. These models can then be shared online for solution needs.
- The second algorithm will load a model to tag a new text.
- Corpus correction and improvement.
- Improvement of the integrated tokenization algorithm when running the tagging algorithm.
- Update of the affix corpus for tokenization needs.

When POS tagging: From the raw_text.txt file, the tagging algorithm will generate two files: A non-tagged segmented file and another tagged one.

Contribution:

Download the corpus, make your modifications, test and then send.
